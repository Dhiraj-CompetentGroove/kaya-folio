Signing up on [StashAway](http://stashaway.sg/) (a [robo-advisor platform](https://blog.moneysmart.sg/invest/robo-advisors-singapore/#what-are-robo-advisors)) back in the early 2020s was the first step in taking control of my financial health. Before that, 100% of my cash was just sitting in a POSB Savings account, growing at an incredibly pointless rate of [0.05% per annum](https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/rates-online/deposit-rates.page). I might as well have kept the money under my mattress.

I was hesitant to invest for years because I used to think any form of investment was risky. Like ~~most~~ some Singaporeans, I ~~am~~ was [_kiasi_](http://www.singlishdictionary.com/). I was afraid of the unknown. What eventually changed my mind was chancing upon this article: [_The big problem (of) playing it too safe with money in our 20s_](https://thewokesalaryman.com/2020/10/16/the-big-problem-playing-it-too-safe-with-money-in-our-20s/) by _thewokesalaryman_, and the following quote:

:::note Quote

Ironically, by not taking any risks and letting all your money get eroded by certain inflation, you are actually doing the riskiest thing.

This quote was the wake-up call for me to start investing, and could be yours too if you are someone who is privileged enough to start doing the same (i.e. you have the financial ability to buy bubble tea at least once a week).

Anyhow, I reasoned the best way to kick-start my investment journey would be with a robo-advisor platform, given how beginner-friendly it is, how low the commission fees are, and ~~how lazy I am~~ given the passive and minimal-effort investment a robo-advisor offers.

You can check out this [page](https://dollarsandsense.sg/robo-advisors-in-singapore-what-you-need-to-know-before-investing/) by _dollarsandsense_ giving an introduction to robo-advisors for more reasons why you should or should not invest with a robo-advisor.

I ended up choosing StashAway, and here are the top 3 reasons why!

## 1. StashAway's all-star C-suite

StashAway is led by an "Expert Investment Team" (their words not mine) made up of the following co-founders:

- Chief Executive Officer Michele Ferrario, a former CEO of [Zalora Group](https://www.zalora.sg/about/) and the co-founder of [Rocket Internet](https://www.rocket-internet.com/)
- Chief Investment Officer Freddy Lim, a former Managing Director and Global Head of Derivatives Strategy at [Nomura](https://www.nomura.com/)
- Chief Technology Officer Nino Ulsamer, the co-founder and former CTO of a now-defunct (oops) software solution company for e-commerce analytics

These guys have real, solid credentials. They are far more experienced in investing than an amateur like me (surprise surprise), and this assured me that my investments in StashAway are handled by well-informed and secure hands. This is also why I will carry on investing with them for the foreseeable future, even when I get better at investing on my own.

## 2. No minimum amount at all

Another robo-advisor platform I was considering at the time was [EndowUs](https://endowus.com/). However, I ultimately went with StashAway because while EndowUs had a minimum investment amount of $10,000.00 (added cents for emphasis), **StashAway had no minimum amount at all**. This is still the case as of today.

As someone new to investing, the $10,000.00 minimum amount was intimidating. More importantly, I was still a student back then, one who did not have that many digits in his bank account. Therefore, StashAway was a natural choice for its low entry barrier!

## 3. My money is safe

Naturally, I was concerned about how safe using StashAway would be, as we should be. More specifically, I was worried about losing my initial investment of $100 in StashAway, in the event of StashAway filing for bankruptcy. As it turned out, it was an unfound concern given that:

:::note Quote

Your money is kept entirely separate from StashAway's finances. To ensure that we never touch your money, we use custodian banks that hold your money, whether it's in cash or in securities.

In these custodian institutions, your assets are always in a segregated account-- one that is separate from StashAway's operations and assets. This means that you will always have full access and claim to your assets no matter what happens to StashAway.
