## Background

**Timeline**

1. **DigiDocs 1.0 - [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)**: January 2019 to October 2020
1. **DigiDocs 2.0 - [Docusaurus v2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/)**: November 2020 to Present

I started my personal documentation website project [DigiDocs](https://digipie.github.io/digidocs/) using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) in January 2019, and kept it updated up until October 2020. I was motivated to do so because I wanted to consolidate useful knowledge gained from attending university classes, and my own self-directed learning.

Back then, I hosted [DigiDocs](https://digipie.github.io/digidocs/) at [evantay.com/docs](https://www.evantay.com/docs/), and a separate portfolio website powered by PHP at [evantay.com](https://www.evantay.com).

I ended up replacing both documentation and portfolio site with a single [Docusaurus v2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/) website (which you're looking at right now). I did so to keep up with the latest technologies, improve site maintainability, and reduce operating costs.
